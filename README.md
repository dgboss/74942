# 74942

This application has three components:
1. A React based frontend
1. A MongoDB database
1. A Flask based backend

The application can be run locally using docker with the following command:
  docker-compose up -d

After running this command, the frontend application can be accesed in a web browser at http://localhost:3000.
The backend application is running at http://localhost:5000

Caution: This application is currently configured to be run in a development setting. The application should not be deployed to a production environment as database names, usernames and passwords are contained within this repository to ease deployment in a development environment.

Instructions for User Story 3:
1. Run the application: `docker-compose up -d`
1. Access the MongoDB container: `docker exec -it mongo bash`
1. Login to mongo: `mongo -u apiuser -p`
1. Enter the password when prompted: `apipassword`
1. Select the database: `use 74942app`
1. Get a collection representing the number of API requests that have been logged: `collection = db.ServiceAreaApiResult`
1. Display a count of the collection: `collection.count()`
1. To quit the database connection: `quit()`
1. To exit the shell: `exit`

Alternative instructions for User Story 3:
The web server /api endpoint returns a count of the number of requests users of the frontend website have made in response to all GET and POST requests.
To view the current count, open a browser and go to http://localhost:5000/api?f=json
